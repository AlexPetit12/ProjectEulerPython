2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?
"""

"""
No need to program for this problem. All I did was finding the least common multiple of
all the numbers from 1 to 20. 

I obtained the prime factorization 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 19 = 232792560
which is the final answer.
